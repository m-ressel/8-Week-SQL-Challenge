# 3. Before & After Analysis

I'm taking the week_date value of 2020-06-15 as the baseline week where the Data Mart sustainable packaging changes came into effect. I include all week_date values for 2020-06-15 as the start of the period after the change and the previous week_date values are before that baseline.
  
Firstly, I find a week_number vaue for 2020-06-15 to use it in next queries.

```
SELECT
DISTINCT week_number
FROM clean_weekly_sales
WHERE week_date = '2020-06-15';
```

| week_number |
| ----------- |
| 25          |

**What is the total sales for the 4 weeks before and after 2020-06-15? What is the growth or reduction rate in actual values and percentage of sales?**


```
WITH four_weeks AS (
  SELECT 
    week_date, 
    week_number, 
    SUM(sales) AS total_sales
  FROM clean_weekly_sales
  WHERE (week_number BETWEEN (25-4) AND (25+3)) 
    AND (year_number = 2020)
  GROUP BY week_date, week_number),
  
  four_weeks_sum AS (
    SELECT 
    SUM(CASE 
        WHEN week_number BETWEEN (25-4) AND 24 THEN total_sales 
        ELSE 0
        END) AS before_baseline,
    SUM(CASE 
        WHEN week_number BETWEEN 25 AND (25+3) THEN total_sales 
        ELSE 0 END) AS after_baseline
  FROM four_weeks)

SELECT 
  before_baseline, 
  after_baseline, 
  after_baseline - before_baseline AS difference, 
  ROUND(100 * (after_baseline - before_baseline) / before_baseline,2) AS percentage
FROM four_weeks_sum;
```

Answer:

| before_baseline | after_baseline | difference | percentage |
| --------------- | -------------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| 2345878357      | 2318994169     | -26884188  | -1.15      |


We see a small percentage decrease in sales in a 4 week period after change compared to 4 weeks before it.

**What about the entire 12 weeks before and after?**


```
WITH twelve_weeks AS (
  SELECT 
    week_date, 
    week_number, 
    SUM(sales) AS total_sales
  FROM clean_weekly_sales
  WHERE (week_number BETWEEN (25-12) AND (25+11)) 
    AND (year_number = 2020)
  GROUP BY week_date, week_number),
  
  twelve_weeks_sum AS (
    SELECT 
    SUM(CASE 
        WHEN week_number BETWEEN (25-12) AND 24 THEN total_sales 
        ELSE 0
        END) AS before_baseline,
    SUM(CASE 
        WHEN week_number BETWEEN 25 AND (25+11) THEN total_sales 
        ELSE 0 END) AS after_baseline
  FROM twelve_weeks)

SELECT 
  before_baseline, 
  after_baseline, 
  after_baseline - before_baseline AS difference, 
  ROUND(100 * (after_baseline - before_baseline) / before_baseline,2) AS percentage
FROM twelve_weeks_sum;

```

Answer:

| before_baseline | after_baseline | difference | percentage |
| --------------- | -------------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| 7126273147      | 6973947753     | -152325394 | -2.14      |


For 12 week period sales are even lower compared to 4 week period in previous question.

**How do the sale metrics for these 2 periods before and after compare with the previous years in 2018 and 2019?**
  
I'll group tables from 2 previous questions by year_date.

```
WITH four_weeks AS (
  SELECT
    week_date, 
    week_number, 
    year_number,
    SUM(sales) AS total_sales
  FROM clean_weekly_sales
  WHERE (week_number BETWEEN (25-4) AND (25+3)) 
  GROUP BY week_date, week_number, year_number),
  
  four_weeks_sum AS (
    SELECT 
    year_number,
    SUM(CASE 
        WHEN week_number BETWEEN (25-4) AND 24 THEN total_sales 
        ELSE 0
        END) AS before_baseline,
    SUM(CASE 
        WHEN week_number BETWEEN 25 AND (25+3) THEN total_sales 
        ELSE 0 END) AS after_baseline
  FROM four_weeks
  GROUP BY year_number)

SELECT
year_number
before_baseline, 
after_baseline, 
after_baseline - before_baseline AS difference, 
  ROUND(100 * (after_baseline - before_baseline) / before_baseline,2) AS percentage
FROM four_weeks_sum;


WITH twelve_weeks AS (
  SELECT 
    week_date, 
    week_number,
  	year_number,
    SUM(sales) AS total_sales
  FROM clean_weekly_sales
  WHERE (week_number BETWEEN (25-12) AND (25+11)) 
  GROUP BY week_date, week_number, year_number),
  
  twelve_weeks_sum AS (
    SELECT 
    year_number,
    SUM(CASE 
        WHEN week_number BETWEEN (25-12) AND 24 THEN total_sales 
        ELSE 0
        END) AS before_baseline,
    SUM(CASE 
        WHEN week_number BETWEEN 25 AND (25+11) THEN total_sales 
        ELSE 0 END) AS after_baseline
  FROM twelve_weeks
  GROUP BY year_number)

SELECT
year_number,
before_baseline, 
after_baseline, 
after_baseline - before_baseline AS difference, 
  ROUND(100 * (after_baseline - before_baseline) / before_baseline,2) AS percentage
FROM twelve_weeks_sum;

```

Answer:

4 weeks:

| before_baseline | after_baseline | difference | percentage |
| --------------- | -------------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| 2018            | 2129242914     | 4102105    | 0.19       |
| 2019            | 2252326390     | 2336594    | 0.10       |
| 2020            | 2318994169     | -26884188  | -1.15      |


12 weeks:
| year_number | before_baseline | after_baseline | difference | percentage |
| ----------- | --------------- | -------------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| 2018        | 6396562317      | 6500818510     | 104256193  | 1.63       |
| 2019        | 6883386397      | 6862646103     | -20740294  | -0.30      |
| 2020        | 7126273147      | 6973947753     | -152325394 | -2.14      |


As we can see, 2020 is the worst year when it comes to sales compared to same periods in 2 previous years.
