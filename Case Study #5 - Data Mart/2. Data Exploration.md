**What range of week numbers are missing from the dataset?**

I'm using built-in function generate_series to create column with numbers from 1 to 52 and compare with it column week_number from clean_weekly_sales.

```
SELECT *
FROM generate_series(1,52)
WHERE generate_series NOT IN (
	SELECT DISTINCT week_number
	FROM clean_weekly_sales);

```

Answer:

| generate_series |
| --------------- |
| 1               |
| 2               |
| 3               |
| 4               |
| 5               |
| 6               |
| 7               |
| 8               |
| 9               |
| 10              |
| 11              |
| 12              |
| 37              |


I've got 28 rows but I'm only displaying first 13.
We're missing values in range 1-12 and 37-52.

**Can we use the avg_transaction column to find the average transaction size for each year for Retail vs Shopify? If not - how would you calculate it instead?**

```
SELECT 
  year_number, 
  platform, 
  ROUND(AVG(avg_transaction),0) AS avg_transaction_from_row, 
  ROUND(SUM(sales)/SUM(transactions)) AS avg_transaction_grouped
FROM clean_weekly_sales
GROUP BY year_number, platform
ORDER BY year_number, platform;
```

Answer:

| year_number | platform | avg_transaction_from_row | avg_transaction_grouped |
| ----------- | -------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| 2018        | Retail   | 43                       | 37                      |
| 2018        | Shopify  | 188                      | 192                     |
| 2019        | Retail   | 42                       | 37                      |
| 2019        | Shopify  | 178                      | 183                     |
| 2020        | Retail   | 41                       | 37                      |
| 2020        | Shopify  | 175                      | 179                     |

avg_transaction_from_row is the average transaction in dollars calculated for each row by taking sales divided by the number of transactions.

avg_transaction_grouped is the average transaction in dollars by taking total sales divided by total number of transactions for the entire table.

avg_transaction_grouped is more accurate, since avg_transaction_from_row is an average of average value.
