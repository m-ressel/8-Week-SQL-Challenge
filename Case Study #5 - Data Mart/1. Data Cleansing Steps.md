# 1. Data Cleansing Steps
  
**In a single query, perform the following operations and generate a new table in the data_mart schema named clean_weekly_sales:
  
* Convert the week_date to a DATE format
* Add a week_number as the second column for each week_date value, for example any value from the 1st of January to 7th of January will be 1, 8th to 14th will be 2 etc
* Add a month_number with the calendar month for each week_date value as the 3rd column
* Add a calendar_year column as the 4th column containing either 2018, 2019 or 2020 values
* Add a new column called age_band after the original segment column using the following mapping on the number inside the segment value
    
| segment |   age_band   |
| ------- | ------------ |
| 1       | Young Adults |
| 2       | Middle Aged  |
| 3 or 4  | Retirees     |
 
* Add a new demographic column using the following mapping for the first letter in the segment values:
    
| segment |  demographic |
| ------- | ------------ |
| C       | Couples      |
| F       | Families     |

* Ensure all null string values with an "unknown" string value in the original segment column as well as the new age_band and demographic columns
* Generate a new avg_transaction column as the sales value divided by transactions rounded to 2 decimal places for each record

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS clean_weekly_sales;

CREATE TABLE clean_weekly_sales AS
  SELECT 
  TO_DATE(week_date,'DD/MM/YY') AS week_date,
  EXTRACT('WEEK' from TO_DATE(week_date,'DD/MM/YY')) AS week_number,
  EXTRACT('MONTH' from TO_DATE(week_date,'DD/MM/YY')) AS month_number,
  EXTRACT('YEAR' from TO_DATE(week_date,'DD/MM/YY')) AS year_number,
  region,
  platform,
  CASE
    WHEN segment = 'null' THEN 'unknown'
    ELSE segment 
  END AS segment,
  CASE
    WHEN RIGHT(segment,1)='1' THEN 'Young Adults'
    WHEN RIGHT(segment,1)='2' THEN 'Middle Aged'
    WHEN RIGHT(segment,1) IN ('3','4') THEN 'Retirees'
    ELSE 'unknown'
  END AS age_band,
  CASE
    WHEN LEFT(segment,1)='C' THEN 'Couples'
    WHEN LEFT(segment,1)='F' THEN 'Families'
    ELSE 'unknown'
  END AS demographic,
  customer_type,
  transactions::numeric,
  sales::numeric,
  ROUND(sales::numeric/transactions::numeric, 2) AS avg_transaction
  FROM weekly_sales;
```
Below you can see first 10 rows of that new table.
